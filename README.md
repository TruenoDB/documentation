The following section expose the **PROS** and **CONS** of Trueno. This may change in the near future.

### What is Trueno good for?

 + Graph analytic at small and big scale
 + Small and large graph data persistent storage
 + Quick starting point and long run graph analytics projects
 + Extendable applications(multiple drivers support)
 + Experiment and design of graph algorithms(via GraphX)

### What is Trueno NOT good for?

- Transactional applications: Trueno does **not** support [transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction).
- Strict consistency requirement: Trueno is [eventual consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency).
