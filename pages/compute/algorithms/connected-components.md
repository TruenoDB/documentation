# Connected Components
---
The connected components of an undirected graph are the equivalence classes of vertices under the "is reachable from" relation [1].

The graph has three components [1]. Connected Components are identified by the lowest vertex ID in the component.

| Component ID   | Components Members |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 | 1,2,5 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 3  | 3,6 |
